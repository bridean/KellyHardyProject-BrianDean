# KellyHardyProject-BrianDean
Test project for KellyHardy

These are the files needed to duplicate this site to a fresh WP install. I got this work done (although incomplete) within under 4hrs on Friday, 11/5/2021, when this work was due, by end of biz day. I was given another deadline, Wednesday 11/10/2021 to finish the rest of this project. Between now and then I'll do a final push, of this site's files in completed form.

For anyone who would duplicate this, here are the steps:

1) Set up a fresh WP install somewhere
2) In Dash > Appearance > Themes, install both Divi.zip and Divi-child.zip. Activate the Divi child theme.
3) Install the .json files in the sections of Divi (within the dashboard) specified in the file names.
4) At Dashboard > Tools > Import, import the XML file that contains the phrase 'all-content' (the only XML file here, actually).

That should be all!
